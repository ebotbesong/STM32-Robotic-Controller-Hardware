# STM32 Robotic Controller
STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller was used for the board design. The STM32F103C8T6 i9s medium density performance line, ARM Cortex-M3 32bit microcontroller in 48 pin LQFP package. It incorporates high performance RISC core with 72MHz operating frequency, high speed embedded memories, extensive range of enhanced I/Os and peripherals connected buses.

This hardware can be used as an alternative to the Arduino and the raspberry pie hardware. Also, the provided design can modified to add more memories.
